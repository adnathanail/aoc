# [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

Everything is in Python

I'm using a library called `advent-of-code-data` to load my input data, so you'll need to install that to run my code

```shell
# (Optional)
python3 -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
# (Required)
pip install -r requirements.pip  #Â Install dependencies
```
